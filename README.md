Tutorial:

Getting ABGameKitHelper up and running is fairly easy, here a step by step guide to get you started:

1. Link "GameKit.framework" with your Project

2. In ABGameKitHelper.h edit SECRET_KEY  to your liking

3. Call following code once the UI of your application is loaded

	<code>[ABGameKitHelper sharedHelper];</code>


3. Thats the basic setup, easy huh? Now on to actually interacting with GameCenter:

<strong>Show Leaderboard</strong>

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedHelper] showLeaderboard:@"leaderboardId"];</code>

<strong>Show Achievements</strong>

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedHelper] showAchievements];</code>

<strong>Report Achievement</strong>

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedHelper] reportAchievement:@"achievementId" percentComplete:100.0f];</code>

<strong>Show Notification</strong> (Shown only once per completed Achievement)

<code>[[ABGameKitHelper sharedHelper] showNotification:@"Notification Title" message:@"Some Message" identifier:@"achievementID"];</code>

<strong>Report Leaderboard Score</strong>

<code>
[[ABGameKitHelper sharedHelper] reportScore:2000 forLeaderboard:@"leaderboardId"];
</code>

<strong>!</strong>
If no Internet connection is present during reporting Achievemnts/Leaderboard Scores are automatically cached and reported the next time the Player authenticates
